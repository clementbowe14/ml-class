        "## Meaning\n",
        "For hundreds of years linguists have been investigating how to encode the semantic information of a word. Some believe that there is a universal mental concept, for example `MOON`, with some universal representation in our brains that gets represented in English as *moon*, in Uyghur as ئاي, as *Hanhepi wi* in Lakota, and as \n",
        "月 in Japanese. It is also believed that  concepts such as `MOON` and `SUN` share some common semantic features. Similar words would cluster together in semantic space. For example, moon, sun, Mars, Neptune, the Milky Way Galaxy seem to have some similarities and form a group as does a group we could label domestic animals that might include horses, dogs, and cats, which in turn are different from wild animals. So words like *dog*, *cat*, *horse*, have, as part of their semantic meaning, some feature that is the same among these words  and that feature is not present in the representations for the words *moon* or *sun*. \n",
        "\n",

Certainly, you can construct sentences that have these sequences that are perfectly fine (*The says who questioning method .*, *Just experimenting with the Says Who basics on myself or with clients*, *The haven't had time excuse*). But the likelihood of the word *says* following *the* is extremely rare. \n",

We wouldn't know that the feature is animal but we would know that they share some feature, let's call it x29. This, as we talked about is a latent feature.\n",
        "\n",

So let's say column 1 was *a* and 2 *the*, and 7,253 *computer* and so on. If we encode a sentence that starts *the computer*, the word *the* would be represented by a '1' in column 1 and zeroes in the other 9,999 columns. The word *computer* would have a '1' in column 7,253 and zeroes in the other 9,999. That is an awful lot of zeroes, and this vector is called **sparse**.
